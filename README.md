# Rate My Teachers
Collaborator: Carmelo Scribano

# Introduction

This is a simulation of a web forum where students and teachers can create accounts, log in, leave comments in specific class pages. We created this purely in PHP and SQL, using PHP as the backend code with a MySQL local database to store user and server data.

# Architecture

We used the MVC ( Model-View-Controller) software pattern in order to seperate each aspect of the application's logic into seperate pieces. This allowed us to easily scale and modify it as necessary, and create structured and clean code.



**Note:** This project was developed locally and then pushed to a repository when finished. Project was developed in a team of two using Real-time code collaboration software.
